SharpOT is an open source Tibia server written completely in managed C#. The project's goal is to emulate the classic OT functionality in a higher level language to make it easier for those who are familiar with .NET to contribute and learn from the code.

SharpOT is by the makers of TibiaAPI, and our hope is that the modular server functionality of SharpOT can be integrated into TibiaAPI and that the two can share a common code base.

SharpOT requires .NET Framework 4.0 and uses [System.Data.SQLite](http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/). Special thanks to the [OpenTibia](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opentibia/) project, which as been an invaluable reference.

*NOTE:* SharpOT is not in any way affiliated with the SharpOTv2 project , which plans to use LUA scripting instead of .NET.
